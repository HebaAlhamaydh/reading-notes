## What is AWS Lambda?
Lambda is a compute service that allows  you run code without supplying or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging
## How does AWS Lambda work?
Each Lambda function runs in its own container on a multi-tenant cluster of machines. Customers don't get much visibility into how the system operates, but they don't need to worry about updating the underlying machines.
