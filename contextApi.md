## Context API
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.
## When to Use Context
Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.For example, in the code below we manually thread through a “theme” prop in order to style the Button component: 
```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Toolbar theme="dark" />;
  }
}

function Toolbar(props) {
  // The Toolbar component must take an extra "theme" prop
  // and pass it to the ThemedButton. This can become painful
  // if every single button in the app needs to know the theme
  // because it would have to be passed through all components.
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton theme={props.theme} />
    </div>
  );
}

class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Button theme={this.props.theme} />;
  }
}
```
Using context, we can avoid passing props through intermediate elements:
```js 
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Use a Provider to pass the current theme to the tree below.
    // Any component can read it, no matter how deep it is.
    // In this example, we're passing "dark" as the current value.
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
        <Toolbar />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}

// A component in the middle doesn't have to
// pass the theme down explicitly anymore.
function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton />
    </div>
  );
}

class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
  // Assign a contextType to read the current theme context.
  // React will find the closest theme Provider above and use its value.
  // In this example, the current theme is "dark".
  static contextType = ThemeContext;
  render() {
    return <Button theme={this.context} />;
  }
}
```
## API
- React.createContext
```js
 const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
 ```

Creates a Context object. When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree.

- Context.Provider 
```js
<MyContext.Provider value={/ some value /}>
```
Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.
## Class.contextType
```js
class MyClass extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* perform a side-effect at mount using the value of MyContext */
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* ... */
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* ... */
  }
  render() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* render something based on the value of MyContext */
  }
}
MyClass.contextType = MyContext;
```
The contextType property on a class can be assigned a Context object created by React.createContext(). Using this property lets you consume the nearest current value of that Context type using this.context. You can reference this in any of the lifecycle methods including the render function.
## Context.Consumer
```js 
<MyContext.Consumer>
  {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
</MyContext.Consumer>
```
A React component that subscribes to context changes. Using this component lets you subscribe to a context within a function component.
